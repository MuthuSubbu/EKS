In this Project, I have implemented the following for a shopping platform
    * VPC setup using terraform
    * EKS setup using terraform
    * Multistage docker builds for microservices written in Golang, Python and Java
    * Created deploy and service kubernetes manifests for deploying all three microservices.
    * Added Github Actions workflow to build and push the changes.
